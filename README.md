# Word-Embeddings

* After running the code, the colab should be able to download `vector.tsv` and `metadata.tsv` files. 

* Go to [Embedding Projector](https://projector.tensorflow.org/) and load the `.tsv` files downloaded and visualize the embeddings on your own!

(full code and readMe will be updated shortly)
